    <p>This is your first step in being a part of our national campaign against crime and money. The alarming rise of
        money and muscle power in elections has resulted in bad governance and unsatisfactory leadership. Our democracy
        is too precious to be left only to the political system or the Election Commission. It needs people to engage,
        or else things will only get worse.
